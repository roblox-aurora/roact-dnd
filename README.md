  <h1>Roact Drag and Drop (D&D)</h1>
</div>

Work-in-progress simple dragging & dropping functionality for Roact.

Plan
===================
* [x] To have a basic way of accomplishing drag & drop
* [x] Support roblox-ts & `@rbxts/roact` out of the gates.
* [x] Start off with `DragFrame` and `DropFrame` - being a wrapper around `Frame` with the extra props and functionalities of this module.
* [x] Eventually custom logic, e.g. `CanDrop` for `DropTarget`, `CanDrag` for `DragSource`
* [ ] Eventually possibly could expand to custom components
